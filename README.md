# 2017-Java-Final-Project
My final project in my Java Collections Class

This program can create, load, and update a .csv file that stores student names and test grades.

The files should be organized properly.  I left the sample .csv files in the top area because the program uses a file explorer to load them anyway.  I did all the organizing manually, so I can't promise that things will work perfectly without a little fiddling.  I'm not sure as yet how to hook my IDE to Github or vice versa.
